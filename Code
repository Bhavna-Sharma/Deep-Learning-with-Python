Program for adding two binary numbers

In the following program, we are using two built-in functions int() and bin().

The int() function converts the given string into an integer number considering the provided base value, in the following example we are converting the string(which is a binary value) into an integer number so we are passing the base value as 2 (binary numbers have base 2, decimals have base value 10).

Once the strings are converted into an integer values then we are adding them and the result is converted back to binary number using the bin() function.


# decimal value 1
num1 = '00001'
# decimal value 17
num2 = '10001'

# sum - decimal value 18
# binary value 10010
sum = bin(int(num1,2) + int(num2,2))
print(sum)
Output:

0b10010
