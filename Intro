Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic  semantics. Its high-level built 
in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, 
as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. 

Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and  therefore reduces the price of 
program maintenance.The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary 
form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Python helps to understand:
