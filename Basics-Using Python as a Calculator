Using Python as Calculator 
The interpreter acts as a simple
 calculator: you can type an 
expression at it and 
it will write the value.
Expression syntax is straightforward: 
the operators are +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (())
 can be utilized for its grouping all together.
 The first thing that youâ€™ll need to do is to import the tkinter package. 
 The tkinter package can be used to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Python.

For Calculator:

operation = input('''
Please type in the math operation you would like to complete:
+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division
''')

n_1 = int(input('Enter your first number: '))
n_2 = int(input('Enter your second number: '))

if operation == '+':                // for addition
print('{} + {} = '.format(n_1, n_2))
print(n_1 + n_2)

elif operation == '-':            //for subtraction
print('{} - {} = '.format(n_1, n_2))
print(n_1 - n_2)

elif operation == '*':          //for Multiplication
print('{} * {} = '.format(n_1, n_2))
print(n_1 * n_2)

elif operation == '/':        //for Division
print('{} / {} = '.format(n_1, n_2))
print(n_1 / n_2)

else:
    print('Use the given operators please :).')
